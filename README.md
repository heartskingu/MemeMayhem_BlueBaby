### About the MOD
This mod adds the "blue baby" (or ???) character from The Binding of Isaac game. I'll keep testing to improve balance and remove/add perks to the pool when necessary

#### Features
* Missile - Poo Cupcake (Increases health regen)
* Perk - (Common) Poo Cupcake (Adds 1 poo cupcake to magazine)
* Perk - (Rare) Poo Party (Adds 3 poo cupcakes to magazine)
* Perk - (Epic) Poo Cake (Increases poo cupcake health regen)
* Relic - (Starting relic) Poison Poo (Increases poison count by 1 when hitting with poo attacks)
* Relic - (Epic) Back Heart (Deal 400 damage for every 600 damage taken)
* Relic - (Legendary) Soul Heart (Increases max health by 5 times per level, but lose regenaration after battle)
* Relic - (Legendary) Soy Milk (Increases attack speed by 300% but reduces strength and energy regen by 90%, applies to buffs received after picking up the relic as well)

#### Comments
Currently the non-permanent relics aren't available in the shop. As soon as developers update the modding api to allow this, I'll update the mod
